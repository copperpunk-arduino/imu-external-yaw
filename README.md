# imu-utils
Helper functions for integrating IMU with external heading measurements. It may have some functions that are useful for generic IMU manipulation.

A simple example will be coming soon. For now, please look to the [IcmInsDualGps](https://github.com/copperpunk-arduino/icm-ins-dual-gps) repository to see how this library is used.
